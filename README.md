# KOSMO-POLY6
KOSMO Format 6 Channel Polyphonic Synthesiser Master Repository 

This repository acts as the master repository for information and documentation for my Poly6 Synthersiser based on an initial idea for a Raspbery Pi Pico DCO ( Digitaly Controlled Oscilator ) by "Polykit" AKA Jan Knipper [DCO](https://github.com/polykit/pico-dco). The PICO-DCO is largely a lift and shift of his work.

The designs are in the format for modular synth created by "Look Mum No Computer" called the Kosmo format, these are 20CM High and multiples of 2.5CM wide depending on the design. 

Modules will be released as and when they are designed, built and tested. Modules on the list below will build towoard a fully fleged 6 voive MIDI Synth.
